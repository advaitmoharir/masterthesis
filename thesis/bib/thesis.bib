Using a sample of 23 models published in top economics journals, we find that reestimating models using revised {GDP} always gives the same qualitative result as the original publication. Estimating models using {GDI} instead of {GDP} gives a different qualitative result for three of 23 models (13\%). ({JEL} C80, C82, E01)},

We show how to incorporate information from multiple releases of noisy data to provide more precise estimates while avoiding some of the identifying assumptions required in earlier work. This relies on a new insight: using multiple data releases allows us to distinguish news and noise measurement errors in situations where a single vintage does not. We find that (a) the data prefer averaging across multiple releases instead of discarding early releases in favor of later ones, and (b) that initial estimates of {GDI} are quite informative. Our new measure, {GDP}++, undergoes smaller revisions and tracks expenditure measures of {GDP} growth more closely than either the simple average of the expenditure and income measures published by the {BEA} or the {GDP} growth measure of Aruoba et al. published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.},

We demonstrate that, following Proposition 99, tobacco consumption fell markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic control region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual per-capita cigarette sales in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have been in the absence of Proposition 99. Using new inferential methods proposed in this article, we demonstrate the significance of our estimates. Given that many policy interventions and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate.},

In this article, we discuss the use of the synthetic control method as a way to bridge the quantitative/qualitative divide in comparative politics. The synthetic control method provides a systematic way to choose comparison units in comparative case studies. This systematization opens the door to precise quantitative inference in small-sample comparative studies, without precluding the application of qualitative approaches. Borrowing the expression from Sidney Tarrow, the synthetic control method allows researchers to put “qualitative flesh on quantitative bones.” We illustrate the main ideas behind the synthetic control method by estimating the economic impact of the 1990 German reunification on West Germany.},

	abstract = {Synthetic control methods are commonly applied in empirical research to estimate the effects of treatments or interventions on aggregate outcomes. A synthetic control estimator compares the outcome of a treated unit to the outcome of a weighted average of untreated units that best resembles the characteristics of the treated unit before the intervention. When disaggregated data are available, constructing separate synthetic controls for each treated unit may help avoid interpolation biases. However, the problem of finding a synthetic control that best reproduces the characteristics of a treated unit may not have a unique solution. Multiplicity of solutions is a particularly daunting challenge when the data include many treated and untreated units. To address this challenge, we propose a synthetic control estimator that penalizes the pairwise discrepancies between the characteristics of the treated units and the characteristics of the units that contribute to their synthetic controls. The penalization parameter trades off pairwise matching discrepancies with respect to the characteristics of each unit in the synthetic control against matching discrepancies with respect to the characteristics of the synthetic control unit as a whole. We study the properties of this estimator and propose data-driven choices of the penalization parameter.},

	abstract = {The synthetic control method ({SCM}) is a popular approach for estimating the impact of a treatment on a single unit in panel data settings. The “synthetic control” is a weighted average of control units that balances the treated unit’s pretreatment outcomes and other covariates as closely as possible. A critical feature of the original proposal is to use {SCM} only when the fit on pretreatment outcomes is excellent. We propose Augmented {SCM} as an extension of {SCM} to settings where such pretreatment fit is infeasible. Analogous to bias correction for inexact matching, augmented {SCM} uses an outcome model to estimate the bias due to imperfect pretreatment fit and then de-biases the original {SCM} estimate. Our main proposal, which uses ridge regression as the outcome model, directly controls pretreatment fit while minimizing extrapolation from the convex hull. This estimator can also be expressed as a solution to a modified synthetic controls problem that allows negative weights on some donor units. We bound the estimation error of this approach under different data-generating processes, including a linear factor model, and show how regularization helps to avoid over-fitting to noise. We demonstrate gains from Augmented {SCM} with extensive simulation studies and apply this framework to estimate the impact of the 2012 Kansas tax cuts on economic growth. We implement the proposed method in the new augsynth R package.},

Nevertheless, the Mariel influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers, even among Cubans who had immigrated earlier. The author suggests that the ability of Miami's labor market to rapidly absorb the Mariel immigrants was largely owing to its adjustment to other large waves of immigrants in the two decades before the Mariel Boatlift.},

We propose a class of matrix completion estimators that uses the observed elements of the matrix of control outcomes corresponding to untreated unit/periods to impute the “missing” elements of the control outcome matrix, corresponding to treated units/periods. This leads to a matrix that well-approximates the original (incomplete) matrix, but has lower complexity according to the nuclear norm for matrices. We generalize results from the matrix completion literature by allowing the patterns of missing data to have a time series dependency structure that is common in social science applications. We present novel insights concerning the connections between the matrix completion literature, the literature on interactive fixed effects models and the literatures on program evaluation under unconfoundedness and synthetic control methods. We show that all these estimators can be viewed as focusing on the same objective function. They differ solely in the way they deal with identification, in some cases solely through regularization (our proposed nuclear norm matrix completion estimator) and in other cases primarily through imposing hard restrictions (the unconfoundedness and synthetic control approaches). The proposed method outperforms unconfoundedness-based or synthetic control estimators in simulations based on real data.},

	abstract = {In a seminal paper Abadie et al (2010) develop the synthetic control procedure for estimating the effect of a treatment, in the presence of a single treated unit and a number of control units, with pre-treatment outcomes observed for all units. The method constructs a set of weights such that covariates and pre-treatment outcomes of the treated unit are approximately matched by a weighted average of control units. The weights are restricted to be nonnegative and sum to one, which allows the procedure to obtain the weights even when the number of lagged outcomes is modest relative to the number of control units, a setting that is not uncommon in applications. In the current paper we propose a more general class of synthetic control estimators that allows researchers to relax some of the restrictions in the {ADH} method. We allow the weights to be negative, do not necessarily restrict the sum of the weights, and allow for a permanent additive difference between the treated unit and the controls, similar to difference-in-difference procedures. The weights directly minimize the distance between the lagged outcomes for the treated and the control units, using regularization methods to deal with a potentially large number of possible control units.},

We posit that the setting can be viewed as an instance of the Latent Variable Model and provide the first finite sample analysis (coupled with asymptotic results) for the estimation of the counterfactual. Our algorithm accurately imputes missing entries and filters corrupted observations in producing a consistent estimator of the underlying signal matrix, provided

	abstract = {Synthetic control method ({SCM}) identifies causal treatment effects by constructing a counterfactual treatment unit as a convex combination of donors in the control group, such that the weights of donors and predictors are jointly optimized during the pre-treatment period. This paper demonstrates that the true optimal solution to the {SCM} problem is typically a corner solution where all weight is assigned to a single predictor, contradicting the intended purpose of predictors. To address this inherent design flaw, we propose to determine the predictor weights and donor weights separately. We show how the donor weights can be optimized when the predictor weights are given, and consider alternative data-driven approaches to determine the predictor weights. Re-examination of the two original empirical applications to Basque terrorism and California's tobacco control program demonstrates the complete and utter failure of the existing {SCM} algorithms and illustrates our proposed remedies.},

It requires the assumption that the average outcomes of treated and control units would have followed parallel paths in the absence of treatment. In this paper, we propose a method that not only relaxes this often-violated assumption, but also unifies the synthetic control method (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller 2010) with linear fixed effects models under a simple framework, of which {DID} is a special case. It imputes counterfactuals for each treated unit using control group information based on a linear interactive fixed effects model that incorporates unit-specific intercepts interacted with time-varying coefficients. This method has several advantages. First, it allows the treatment to be correlated with unobserved unit and time heterogeneities under reasonable modeling assumptions. Second, it generalizes the synthetic control method to the case of multiple treated units and variable treatment periods, and improves efficiency and interpretability. Third, with a built-in cross-validation procedure, it avoids specification searches and thus is easy to implement. An empirical example of Election Day Registration and voter turnout in the United States is provided.},

In macroeconomics, interactive effects represent unobservable common shocks and their heterogeneous impacts on cross sections. We consider identification, consistency, and the limiting distribution of the interactive-effects estimator. Under both large N and large T, the estimator is shown to be consistent, which is valid in the presence of correlations and heteroskedasticities of unknown form in both dimensions. We also derive the constrained estimator and its limiting distribution, imposing additivity coupled with interactive effects. The problem of testing additive versus interactive effects is also studied. In addition, we consider identification and estimation of models in the presence of a grand mean, time-invariant regressors, and common regressors. Given identification, the rate of convergence and limiting results continue to hold.},

	shorttitle = {{mRSC}},
	abstract = {When evaluating the impact of a policy (e.g., gun control) on a metric of interest (e.g., crime-rate), it may not be possible or feasible to conduct a randomized control trial. In such settings where only observational data is available, synthetic control ({SC}) methods [2-4] provide a popular data-driven approach to estimate a "synthetic" or "virtual" control by combining measurements of "similar" alternatives or units (called "donors"). Recently, robust synthetic control ({RSC}) [7] was proposed as a generalization of {SC} to overcome the challenges of missing data and high levels of noise, while removing the reliance on expert domain knowledge for selecting donors. However, both {SC} and {RSC} (and its variants) suffer from poor estimation when the pre-intervention period is too short. As the main contribution of this work, we propose a generalization of unidimensional {RSC} to multi-dimensional Robust Synthetic Control, {mRSC}. Our proposed mechanism, {mRSC}, incorporates multiple types of measurements (or metrics) in addition to the measurement of interest for estimating a synthetic control, thus overcoming the challenge of poor inference due to limited amounts of pre-intervention data. We show that the {mRSC} algorithm, when using K relevant metrics, leads to a consistent estimator of the synthetic control for the target unit of interest under any metric. Our finite-sample analysis suggests that the mean-squared error ({MSE}) of our predictions decays to zero at a rate faster than the {RSC} algorithm by a factor of K and √K for the training (pre-intervention) and testing (post-intervention) periods, respectively. Additionally, we propose a principled scheme to combine multiple metrics of interest via a diagnostic test that evaluates if adding a metric can be expected to result in improved inference. Our mechanism for validating {mRSC} performance is also an important and related contribution of this work: time series prediction. We propose a method to predict the future evolution of a time series based on limited data when the notion of time is relative and not absolute, i.e., where we have access to a donor pool that has already undergone the desired future evolution. We conduct extensive experimentation to establish the efficacy of {mRSC} in three different scenarios: predicting the evolution of a metric of interest using synthetically generated data from a known factor model, and forecasting weekly sales and score trajectories of a Walmart store and Cricket game, respectively.},

	abstract = {We develop a theoretical framework of analyzing preliminary announcements of economic data and then apply this framework to the money stock. We find that preliminary announcements of the money stock are best characterized as measured with classical errors-in-variables. That is, the revision is not correlated with the true value of the series. The revision is, however, forecastable using information available at the time of the preliminary announcement. Our ability to forecast the revision implies that preliminary announcements are not rational estimates of the true money stock.},
