# Estimating the impact of methodological change on India's GDP

Chapter - 1 introduced the issue of measurement error in GDP estimation, focussing specifically on the debate in India. Lack of income - side estimates, and metholodoligcal opacity make it difficult to assess the extent to which India's GDP is over/under estimated. Experts are forced to rely on sector - specific anomalies or rely on contradictions observed in fast - moving sectoral data, making it difficult to make causal claims about aggregate data. The key difficulty, in summary, is to estimate a counterfactual GDP series.

The synthetic control method offers to be a promising alternative in this regard. Chapter - 2 establishes the SCM to be a popular tool to find the causal effect of a policy/intervention on a large unit like a country, state or city. The
